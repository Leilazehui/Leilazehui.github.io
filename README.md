### About me

Hi, this is Leila. I am recording my academic projects, work experience and interesting moments here. Other than mechanical engieneering, I am particularly interested in space exploration, extraterrestrial life and astrology. In the mean time, I like star-gazing and hiking. Currently, I am learning CFD, Programming and AI, hardware development for my final year project and side-projects as well. Feel free to connect and chat through leilazhao853@gmail.com
