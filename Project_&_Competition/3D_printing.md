### 3D Printing Study Regarding the material properties of 3D printing Filaments Sept - Oct 2024

**Descriptions:** Material testing (study mainly on 3D printing filament), and design model plane and manufacturing with other team members.
- Designed structure of the ribs and conduct weight analysis with different 3D pritning materials. As wood is the common material used for aircraft manufacturing, in this study, it is to compare the properties between wood and 3D printing materials to see if wood can be replaced by 3D pritning materials in terms of weight, structure rigidity, strength, etc.
- Material compared include PLA, TPU, PLA Aero, Wood, Resin SLA etc.

Conceptual Idea and Design:

Result Table of different materials I tested, and eventually it is concluded wooden material is still lighter than all the 3D printing materials tested in this study.
