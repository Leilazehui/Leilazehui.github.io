### DBF Aircraft Design, Jul 2024 - Now

**Role:** Team Captain/Chief Engieneer/Aerodynamic Lead

**Tools:** SolidWorks, XFLR5, ANSYS, 3D Printing, Communication

**Description:**
- Team Captain: Oversee the team progress, schedule meeting with faculty supervisor, recuit members and manage required documents for competition application.
- Chief Engineer: Care for teammates' individual parts' study, provide suggestions and support for teammates' design and personal situation to make sure the progress is on the track.
- Aerodynamic Lead: In charge of Aerodynamic Analysis which include literature study and calculation of main wing, Conducting CFD simulation for airfoils, 3D wing model and the model aircraft on Xflr5 and Ansys.
- Banner Attachment and Deployment Mechanism: Design an attchment and deployment mechanism using SolidWorks and 3D Printing for the banner which can be towed and released through remote-control during flight.

I was a non-final-year member in AIAA team 2025, where I assisted in plane manufacturing and logisitcs during the competition site in US in April 2025
